main.go: Entry point, parses args, passes files/dirs to analyzer.

analyzer/scanner.go: Parses Go source files into AST, coordinates registry + detectors.

analyzer/registry/: Tracks workflow functions & call graph. Decides which funcs are workflow-reachable.

analyzer/detectors/: Pluggable rules (time, randomness, IO, goroutines, channels).

config/loader.go: Loads rules.yaml dynamically so detectors arenâ€™t hardcoded.

tests/: Unit tests for detectors, multi-file reachability, etc.

testdata/: Example source files that simulate workflow + activity code (including edge cases).
